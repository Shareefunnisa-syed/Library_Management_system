  --------->> ðŸ“š Library Management System using Python --------------  

--> A Python-based console project developed to automate the process of managing a library system through file handling.  
--> The system facilitates book inventory operations like adding, removing, borrowing, and returning books.  
--> It distinguishes between **admin** and **user** roles to streamline library activities and ensure accurate data maintenance.  
--> Book and transaction records are stored using **JSON files**, eliminating the need for a database.  
--> The goal is to simulate real-time library management in an efficient and lightweight manner suitable for small-scale environments.
### Key Features:

----> Admin Panel:
- Add new books to inventory  --- Remove existing books  ---- View complete book list

----> User Interface:
- View available books  - Borrow books based on availability  - Return borrowed books  - View list of borrowed books by user  

---- > Technologies Used:
- Python 3.x  - File Handling using `json` module  - Console-based interaction  - Python data structures: lists & dictionaries
